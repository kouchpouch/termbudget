## termBudget💲

## Warning
### This project is a work in progress. For testing only.

* My first real C project.
* All these budgeting apps these days are a pain and filled with bloat. Why not just budget in your terminal? Throw vim to another window and get your finances in order with termBudget--then get back to programming.
* May or may not include memory leaks!
* Uses ncurses
